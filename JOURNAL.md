### A little backstory:

I recently purchased a ThinkPad T430 for 60 dollars ($35 in freedom coins). It's pretty nice, though it's missing a battery and an optical drive. I ordered a new battery, but who even uses disks nowadays? So, left with this empty space on the side of my laptop, of course I started thinking about what I could put there. Initially, I considered building a WiFi adapter module with an external antenna. Sure, it would look sick - but realistically, I can just plug one in via USB. That brought me down to two main ideas:

- An SDR module** (Software Defined Radio)
- A Raspberry Pi co-processor module

I ended up going with the latter, mainly because SDRs are expensive :(
