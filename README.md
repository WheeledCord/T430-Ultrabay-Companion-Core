# ThinkPad T430 Ultrabay Companion Core

A  co-processor module designed to replace the Ultrabay of a ThinkPad T430 (Though it should be compatible with any thinkpad using a Serial Ultrabay Enhanced). It will use the bayâ€™s 5V SATA power line to run a Raspberry Pi Zero, allowing the laptop to offload auxiliary tasks to a dedicated embedded system.
